Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for image-to-image translation, specifically transforming images of horses into zebras (and potentially vice versa). It leverages the popular CycleGAN horse2zebra dataset from TensorFlow Datasets to train and test the model.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning frameworks where two neural networks — a generator and a discriminator — compete to produce increasingly realistic outputs. A Conditional GAN extends this by conditioning the generation process on additional information (like an input image).

Project Brief
Dataset: The project uses the cycle_gan/horse2zebra dataset, containing paired images of horses and zebras.

Preprocessing: Images are normalized to the range [-1, 1] to stabilize GAN training.

Architecture: While not all code is shown here, typical cGAN setups use a U-Net-based generator and a PatchGAN discriminator for detailed output.

Goal: Given an image of a horse, the generator learns to translate it into an image that resembles a zebra (or vice versa), capturing texture and style while preserving the underlying structure.

This kind of project has applications in style transfer, artistic filters, and domain adaptation tasks in computer vision.
