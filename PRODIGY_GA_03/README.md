📚 Markov Chain Text Generation
🚀 Overview
This project implements a flexible Markov chain-based text generator in Python.
It builds a statistical model that predicts the probability of a word (or character) given the previous ones, and uses it to generate new, coherent text sequences.
The implementation is modular, configurable for any order (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams...) and includes basic visualization of transition patterns.

✨ Features
✅ Build Markov chains of any order (n-grams)
✅ Generate realistic text sequences from learned probabilities
✅ Easily switch between word-level or character-level modeling
✅ Visualize next-token frequency distributions and transition sparsity
✅ Designed to run smoothly in Google Colab

🔍 How It Works
Text Preprocessing:

Cleans and tokenizes input text into words (or characters).

Training:

Constructs a Markov chain by mapping (previous N tokens) -> next token transitions.

Generation:

Samples the next token based on the probabilities observed in training.

Visualization:

Plots frequency histograms of likely next tokens and shows transition matrix sparsity.
