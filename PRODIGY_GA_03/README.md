**Text_Generation_Using_Markov_Chain**

 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bS8IybWX1PNszFDxnuZx_13HUjZs2as6?usp=sharing)

This project demonstrates a text generation system using Markov Chains, a classic probabilistic model used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Unlike deep learning-based approaches like GPT-2, Markov chains generate text by modeling the probability of a word occurring based on its preceding word(s).

Markov models are simple yet powerful tools for generating text that mimics the statistical structure of a given dataset. They're particularly useful for understanding sequence modeling and for building lightweight text generators.

üîç Project Brief

The notebook performs the following tasks:

Text Cleaning & Tokenization
Reads a raw text file.
Cleans the data using regex to remove punctuation and special characters.
Tokenizes the content into individual words.
Transition Matrix Generation
Builds a transition matrix that records how frequently one word follows another.
This matrix is the core of the Markov model.
Text Generation
Randomly picks a starting word.
Uses the transition probabilities to generate a new sequence of words.
The generated text mimics the statistical style of the original dataset.
üß∞ Tools & Libraries

Python üêç
NumPy
Regular Expressions (re)
Matplotlib (optional, if used for visualizing transitions)
