🧠 Text Generation using GPT-2

📌 Introduction

This project showcases a simple yet powerful demonstration of text generation using GPT-2, a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI. GPT-2 is known for its ability to generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence, making it a popular model for tasks like story generation, code completion, dialogue simulation, and more.

The implementation leverages the Hugging Face transformers library, which provides pre-trained models and tokenizers to make natural language processing (NLP) tasks more accessible and efficient.

🚀 Project Brief

The notebook performs the following tasks:

Model & Tokenizer Loading:
Loads the pre-trained GPT2LMHeadModel and GPT2Tokenizer from Hugging Face.
Input Preprocessing:
A custom input string ("I love GenAI Internship!") is tokenized into a format suitable for the model.
Text Generation:
Using beam search decoding (num_beams=5), the model generates a coherent and extended text based on the input prompt. To ensure quality, techniques like no_repeat_ngram_size=2 and early_stopping=True are used to avoid repetitive patterns.
Decoding:
The generated output is decoded back into human-readable text.
